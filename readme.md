# Welcome to the FitTrack Readme

I need a lightweight tracker to use at the gym to keep an eye on my rep times and numbers.
I've been using clickcounter, but this is not ideal.
Trying to build a simple web-based timer app that uses web API.


The idea here is that there will be field for:

#of Rep --> once this is clicked, it will start a timer for the rest interval set. 


Ideally, this would also track current 1 rm of any exercise and disply percentages in increments of 5%



Settings:
- Rest time
- Number of reps
- Set 1rm
