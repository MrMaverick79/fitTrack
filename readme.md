# Welcome to the FitTrack Readme

## Project by Brendan Tuckerman 2022

---------------------------------

**background**

I need a lightweight tracker to use at the gym to keep an eye on my rep times and numbers.
I've been using clickcounter, but this is not ideas as it does not have a timer function.
This web-based app is a simple counter for use at the gym. 

**To use**

- Set the number of minutes that you intend to rest between each set.
- After you have finished a set, use the + button to increase the set count.
- This will start a timer for the set amount of seconds.
- You can clear, pause, add 30 seconds with the appropriate buttons.

Enjoy! B. Tuckerman / NewTrick
